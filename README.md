# api_request with Python üêç


 How to use Requests module to talk to external applications or external urls and then do something with the response that I get.
 By first converting that to an actual data type, I used the .json() function to convert the data into a List.
 Then do something with that response value.
 
 In this app I bring the name and url (repos url) from my own github user and show it.
